## Hi I’m Divyani 👋

I am a B.Tech Computer Science graduate from Graphic Era Deemed to be University with industry experience at Amazon.I work across agentic AI, CI/CD intelligence, backend and cloud systems, focusing on autonomous engineering intelligence and reasoning over codebases. Currently, I explore LLM-based agents and self-healing DevOps while working as a self-employed developer and problem solving hackathon participant.

💬 Ask Me About…
- Why CI/CD failures are usually symptoms, not problems
- How agentic AI differs from chat-based DevOps tools
- Designing systems that engineers actually trust
- Or why most “AI copilots” panic at the first flaky test

⚡ Fun fact: I trust a system more if it can explain why it failed than if it claims it never will.


***The engineering is not about better dashboards — it’s the systems that think, reason, and act.***

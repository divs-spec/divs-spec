## Hi I’m Divyani 👋

I am a software engineer focused on building autonomous engineering systems that reduce cognitive load for developers. My work spans agentic AI, CI/CD intelligence, backend systems, and cloud-native architectures, with a strong emphasis on reasoning over codebases rather than treating systems as black boxes. I have hands-on experience designing production-grade services, debugging large-scale systems, and automating failure diagnosis. Currently, I am exploring LLM-based agents, low-level and high-level system design, and self-healing DevOps workflows. Alongside hackathon participation, I work as a self-employed software developer, building practical systems that prioritize reliability, clarity, and engineering judgment over manual intervention.

💬 Ask Me About…
- Why CI/CD failures are usually symptoms, not problems
- How agentic AI differs from chat-based DevOps tools
- Designing systems that engineers actually trust
- Or why most “AI copilots” panic at the first flaky test

⚡ Fun fact: I trust a system more if it can explain why it failed than if it claims it never will.


***The engineering is not about better dashboards — it’s the systems that think, reason, and act.***
